# Learning Semantics and Writing Readme's

Learning semantics for html can be a little confusing for me. But after some time looking into it and using **Chrome Dev Tools**, I think I got it down... Or at least have a _better_ understanding of semantics and accessability for HTML.

## The Changes I Made

I changed a majority of the `div` tags to their respective hierarchy. For example, I changed the `div` tag for the header to a `header` tag, the `div` for the footer to `footer`, and so on. While making these changes, I did have to make some changes in the CSS file to corospond to the repective tag, so that nothing would _break_. Afterwards, I opened up the HTML and with **Chrome Dev Tools**, I looked through to make sure eveything was correct. I did also try to use the **Lighthouse** feature within the Dev Tools but was unable to utilize it.

## Writing Up This README and Learning Markdown

Learning how to use Markdown is actully pretty fun. I've been reading through the articles provided in the Resources channel in Slack and found a website that lets you **_code Markdown as you learn about it_**! Here is the [link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to the website I used. It has been extremely helpful and fun to go through it and see what each type of markdown looks like in real time. I also used [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) to look up any other functions I was unfamiliar with.

### Additional Comments

I thought this assignment was fun. It was really cool to learn what semantics is and also learning markdown. Going into this program, I didn't have much knowledge about coding but have always wanted to get into this line of work. Now that I'm here, I can't wait to learn more.
